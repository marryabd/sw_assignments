    "# Finite State Machine (FSM) and ModThreeFSM: An Object-Oriented Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction:\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through the implementation of a specific Finite State Machine (FSM) and its subclass, **ModThreeFSM**, which computes the remainder when dividing a binary number by 3. This FSM solution uses **Object-Oriented Design** (OOD) principles, focusing on **modularity**, **encapsulation**, and **reusability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is broken down into the following key sections:\n",
    "- **Our FSM solution**: How we designed the FSM to handle state transitions.\n",
    "- **ModThreeFSM**: A specialized FSM to calculate the remainder of a binary number divided by 3.\n",
    "- **How our design follows OOD**: Explanation of how this solution adheres to key OOD principles.\n",
    "- **Examples**: Demonstrating the functionality with sample inputs.\n",

    "## 2. The FiniteStateMachine Class: A Flexible and Reusable Template\n",
    "\n",
    "The `FiniteStateMachine` class is designed as a generic, reusable template for building any finite state machine, following key Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles like **abstraction** and **encapsulation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in Our FSM Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Abstraction\n",
    "- The `FiniteStateMachine` is implemented as an **abstract base class**, with an abstract `transition()` method that must be implemented by each subclass. This ensures that the FSM’s structure is reusable across different problems.\n",
    "- **Why This Matters**: Abstraction allows the core FSM structure to be reused while giving subclasses the flexibility to implement specific transition logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Encapsulation\n",
    "- FSM attributes such as `states`, `alphabet`, and `transitions` are encapsulated as **private** variables, accessible through **property methods**. This protects the FSM’s internal data from direct modification.\n",
    "- **Why This Matters**: Encapsulation ensures the FSM’s integrity, making it more robust and harder to misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Warning and Exception Handling\n",
    "- **Exception Handling**: If an input symbol is not in the alphabet, or if the FSM tries to return an invalid final state, `ValueError` is raised. \n",
    "- **Why This Matters**: Proper error handling ensures that invalid input or states are flagged immediately, preventing unpredictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. State Management\n",
    "- The FSM tracks its `current_state`, which is publicly accessible and updated based on input transitions.\n",
    "- **Why This Matters**: Exposing the current state allows external components to observe or reset the FSM state while keeping other critical attributes protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Reset Functionality\n",
    "- The FSM can be reset to its initial state at any time using the `reset()` method, allowing it to process multiple input sequences cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This design ensures **flexibility**, **robustness**, and **reusability**, enabling developers to define specific FSM behaviors in subclasses like `ModThreeFSM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. ModThreeFSM: A Specialized FSM for Binary Division by 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The **ModThreeFSM** is a subclass of the `FiniteStateMachine` that specializes in computing the remainder when a binary number is divided by 3. It operates with three states (`S0`, `S1`, `S2`), corresponding to the remainders of 0, 1, and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class builds on the base FSM functionality by overriding the abstract `transition()` method and implementing a specific method, `compute_remainder()`, to solve the Mod 3 problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Requirements in ModThreeFSM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overriding the Abstract `transition()` Method\n",
    "`ModThreeFSM` implements the `transition()` method, which handles state transitions based on input symbols (`0` or `1`). The method looks up the current state and input symbol in the transitions dictionary and updates the FSM accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The `transition()` method checks the current state and input symbol against the predefined transitions.\n",
    "- If a transition isn’t found, the FSM remains in the current state as a fallback and generates a **warning** to notify the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific Method: `compute_remainder()`\n",
    "`ModThreeFSM` introduces a specific method called `compute_remainder()`, which processes a binary string, simulates the FSM’s state transitions, and computes the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Resetting**: Before each computation, the FSM is reset to the initial state (`S0`), ensuring that previous results don’t affect the current run.\n",
    "- **Handling Empty Input**: If an empty binary string is passed, the method returns `0`.\n",
    "- **Input Processing**: The binary string is processed using `process_input()`, and each symbol updates the FSM state.\n",
    "- **Final State Mapping**: The final state is mapped to a remainder using a `remainder_map`, with `S0` mapped to `0`, `S1` to `1`, and `S2` to `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. How the Solution Follows Object-Oriented Design (OOD) Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The **FiniteStateMachine** and **ModThreeFSM** classes adhere to key **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** principles, ensuring a solution that is **modular**, **reusable**, and **maintainable**. Below is a summary of the OOD principles applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Abstraction\n",
    "- The `FiniteStateMachine` class abstracts the common FSM structure, and the `transition()` method is defined as abstract. This enforces that each subclass must implement its own state transition logic, keeping the design flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Encapsulation\n",
    "- Key FSM attributes (`__states`, `__alphabet`, `__transitions`) are private and accessed via property methods. This ensures that internal data cannot be modified directly, protecting the integrity of the FSM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Inheritance\n",
    "- `ModThreeFSM` inherits from `FiniteStateMachine`, reusing the generic state management features while implementing specific behavior for Mod 3 remainders. This promotes code reuse and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Polymorphism\n",
    "- The abstract `transition()` method enables **polymorphism** by allowing different FSM implementations to share the same interface while exhibiting different behaviors. The `process_input()` method works consistently across all FSM subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "- Each class has a single, clear responsibility: `FiniteStateMachine` handles generic FSM mechanics, while `ModThreeFSM` handles Mod 3 transitions. This makes the design easier to maintain and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "- The FSM design is **open for extension** but **closed for modification**. Subclasses extend the base FSM functionality without altering its internal logic, following the OCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",
    "- Any subclass of `FiniteStateMachine` (such as `ModThreeFSM`) can replace the base class without altering program behavior. This ensures that all FSMs can be used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n",
    "- The `FiniteStateMachine` class defines a simple, minimal interface, requiring only essential methods like `transition()` to be implemented by subclasses. This avoids burdening subclasses with unnecessary functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n",
    "- The base FSM logic does not depend on specific state transition details. Instead, subclasses like `ModThreeFSM` handle their own transitions, making the high-level FSM design independent of specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This FSM solution follows key OOD principles such as **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**, ensuring a design that is flexible, scalable, and robust. The application of SOLID principles further enhances the **modularity** and **reusability** of the solution.\n",
