    "# Find Best Threshold\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the `find_best_threshold` function, which is designed to determine the optimal threshold for classification problems. The function takes lists of thresholds, true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), true negatives (TN), and false positives (FP) as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of the function is to find the best threshold that maximizes recall (greater than or equal to 0.9) while also maximizing precision when possible. The function also includes mechanisms to handle various edge cases, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All inputs being zero\n",
    "- Valid inputs that yield recall below the required threshold\n",
    "- Handling combinations of true positives and false negatives that affect the calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, users will have a clear understanding of how to use the function, what to expect in different scenarios, and how the function handles corner cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "### `find_best_threshold`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find_best_threshold` function is designed to determine the optimal threshold for classification problems by evaluating the relationship between true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **thresholds (list)**: A list of threshold values (float) to evaluate.\n",
    "- **tp (list)**: A list of true positives corresponding to each threshold.\n",
    "- **fn (list)**: A list of false negatives corresponding to each threshold.\n",
    "- **tn (list, optional)**: A list of true negatives corresponding to each threshold. Default is `None`.\n",
    "- **fp (list, optional)**: A list of false positives corresponding to each threshold. Default is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **float or None**: The function returns the best threshold that yields recall greater than or equal to 0.9 and maximizes precision (if FP is provided). If no threshold meets the condition, the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raises\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ValueError**: The function raises a ValueError if any of the following conditions are met:\n",
    "  - Mandatory input lists (thresholds, TP, FN) are empty.\n",
    "  - Any input value is negative.\n",
    "  - Input lists are of different lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The function evaluates each threshold and calculates recall based on the provided TP and FN values. If both TP and FN are zero for a threshold, a warning is issued, and that threshold is skipped. The function also computes precision if FP and TN values are provided and updates the best threshold accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is robust against various edge cases, ensuring that users receive appropriate warnings when inputs are not valid for threshold calculations.\n"

However, it can still compute the recall for each threshold using the available TP and FN.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Choosing the Best Threshold**:\n",
    "   - If multiple valid thresholds exist in the `valid_thresholds` list and precision cannot be calculated due to missing TN and FP, the function defaults to choosing the minimum valid threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rationale for Choosing Minimum Threshold**: Selecting the minimum threshold aligns with the idea that a lower threshold may help increase true positives (TP) while minimizing false negatives (FN). This is especially important in classification problems where catching as many positive instances as possible is prioritized.\n",
